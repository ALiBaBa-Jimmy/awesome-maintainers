# Contributing

Additional suggestions are welcomed! Please [open a PR](https://github.com/nayafia/awesome-maintainers/pulls).

Criteria:
* Content is about the experience of being an open source maintainer
* The author of the content is describing their own experience

This list is sorted alphabetically by maintainer username. Sub-bullets are also sorted alphabetically by title. The format is as follows:

```
[USERNAME](https://github.com/USERNAME), [PROJECT NAME](https://github.com/PROJECT-URL)
  * "TITLE" ([video/slides/post/interview](URL))
```

If they don't have a GitHub profile, or their project isn't on GitHub, link to the equivalent elsewhere. Links should point to their developer profile and repository over personal or project websites.
